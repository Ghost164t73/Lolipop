In the quiet of the night, stars gleam,
Dreams twirl in a cosmic, silent scheme.
Moonlight whispers, a soft lullaby,
As time dances, and hours fly by. <br>
<br>
Basketball bouncing, a rhythmic beat,
Coding languages, a dance so sweet.
In the realm where passions collide,
A teenager's journey, an adventurous ride. <br>
<br>
Money's pursuit, a quest untold,
Yet in every endeavor, let hearts unfold.
Yunus, the architect of dreams,
In each sunrise, a new story beams. <br>
<br>
May your days be filled with joy and cheer,
As you navigate through the atmosphere.
Basketball, coding, and fortune's kiss,
Embrace the journey, embrace the bliss.

const Humpty = `
My heart's like humpty dumpty
Everytime it shatters to a million pieces
Piece by piece I fix my heart
But there's not enough pieces

I'm getting tired of fixing my heart 
I don't really have good puzzle skills
I am puzzled at how my heart still functions 
It's been shattered one to many times

And an explanation would be good
I'd love to understand how my heart has the ability to love
How i still fall head over heels for someone even when I can't stand on my feet
I'm desperate for an answer, I need to end this trend.
`
let love = `Did I fall for you? <br>
I don't know.<br>
cause when you fall it's a drop without knowing but falling for you was like slipping into a ditch purposely and having no regrets <br>
<br>
But when it came to you i didn't fall in I jumped<br>
I knew the consequences and pain , I knew the height I was willing to drop to .... I knew my valley<br>
<br>
And as a blind girl I jumped in ignoring the ache ,disaster and misery<br>
<br>
And if anybody asks me if I regret it I'll show my biggest scar and say it's my favorite cause it's from you`

const intimacy = `Our generation sees intimacy as a whole different thing.<br>
<br>
Intimacy is not soley about physical closeness,it's not just about the feeling of one's touch<br>
<br>
Intimacy is about connecting with the one you love <br>
A connection that can contradict any form of distance.`;

const touch = `
    I never knew what the feeling of one's touch meant till I met the one<br>
    His lips so soft I could kiss him forever<br>
<br>
When his lips touch mine it's more than butterflies in my stomach<br>
It's more of light bugs in a dark place<br>
<br>
I could see my world in it can't even look at it cause it's beauty takes me away<br>
<br>
When he holds me it's like I'm floating and when he's not near I'm like a dry leaf<br>
<b>Oh!</b><br>
What a predicament it is<br>
